> A simple binary to decimal converter (and vice-versa) using ReactJS.

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

This project was an intitial effort to help me get a basic understanding of how to program static websites using exlusively Javascript. Namely NodeJS, ExpressJS, and ReactJS. The idea for this came from the [App Ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repo. I'm using it as a set of projects to improve my capabilities in this area. You can see the requirements in the [Reqs Doc](https://github.com/joshjab/Simple-Bin2Dec-Website/blob/master/Bin2Dec-AppReq.md) on this repo.

### Prerequisites

To run this website, you should only need NodeJS and the Node Package Manager(NPM). This can be installed on Debian systems with the following commmand. 
```
sudo apt-get install npm
```
Note: NodeJS version must be v8 or above to run the ReactJS framework

### Installing

#### Step 1
Clone the repository

```
#### Step 2
